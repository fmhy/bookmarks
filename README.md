This repository is programmed to automatically generate browser bookmarks and Brave Search Engine "Goggle" for FMHY.

## Goggle

Use https://search.brave.com/goggles?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ffmhy%2Fbookmarks%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Ffmhy.goggle

The goggles are automatically updated weekly through Github Actions with the new changes from FMHY.

## Bookmarks

Bookmarks are generated as HTML files which can be imported into any web browser.

The HTML files are automatically updated weekly with the new changes from FMHY.

### Why?

Web browsers have auto-complete and search functions that are based on bookmarked pages, so its helpful to have interesting sites bookmarked, so you can find them quicker and make sure you are on the right URL.
